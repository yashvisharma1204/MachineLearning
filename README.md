This project explores the relationship between various factors (like years of experience) and salary using linear regression. The goal is to create a model that can predict salary based on these factors.

## 📝 Overview
The project uses a dataset containing employee information, including age, gender, education level, job title, years of experience, and salary. The primary focus is on linear regression analysis to identify trends and relationships.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating the linear regression model.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `dataset`: Contains the dataset used for this analysis.
- `Salary.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebooks with the code for data exploration, visualization, and model building. Contains output and visualizations from the analysis.

## 📊 Project Highlights
- **Data Exploration:** Cleaning and transforming the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Linear Regression Model: **Training and evaluating a linear regression model to predict salary based on years of experience.
- **Visualizations:** Scatter plots, histograms, and regression lines to visualize the relationship between factors.

## 📈 Results and Insights
The linear regression model showed a positive correlation between years of experience and salary. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) metrics indicated good model performance, with visualizations providing further confirmation.

## 🔮 Next Steps
Further development could involve exploring additional features, addressing outliers, and experimenting with more complex models. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
